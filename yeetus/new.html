<p>Bilbo Baggins was a Hobbit of the Shire, the main protagonist of The Hobbit and a secondary character in The Lord of the Rings.

Gandalf suggested Bilbo Baggins to be hired by Thorin and Company to be their burglar in the Quest of Erebor, and later fought in the Battle of the Five Armies. Bilbo was also one of the bearers of the One Ring, and the first to voluntarily give it up, although with some difficulty. He wrote many of his adventures in a book he called There and Back Again. Bilbo adopted Frodo Baggins as his nephew after his parents, Drogo Baggins and Primula Brandybuck, drowned in the Brandywine River.

Bilbo was the first Hobbit to become famous in the world at large, and was one of the few to visit the The Undying Lands across the ocean.

*He is possibly named after a type of sword popularly used in the 16th century (which is also called Bilbo) </p>
